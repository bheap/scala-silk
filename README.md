# SILK WEB TOOLKIT

## About

A Scala publishing toolkit from [bheap ltd](http://www.bheap.co.uk) and the [community](http://www.silkyweb.org/community.html).

Silk allows you to build static websites out of re-usable building blocks without the use of server side languages, just use HTML, CSS and Javascript.  Sites built with Silk are clean from semantic pollution, no tag soup.  Dynamic webapps are in the pipeline too, (but not yet).

## Status

Silk is currently considered to be proof of concept only.  The code is only at 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT and is very suspect in many places.  We will be tidying this up over the coming weeks.  We expect the overall structure to change considerably.

Despite this, it is already possible to build some decent static sites with the project, details below.
