# SILK WEB TOOLKIT

## About

A Scala publishing toolkit from [bheap](http://www.bheap.co.uk) and the [community](http://www.silkyweb.org/community.html) ltd

## Status

Silk is currently considered to be proof of concept only.  The code is only at 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT and is very suspect in many places.  We will be tidying this up over the coming weeks.  We expect the overall structure to change considerably.

Despite this, it is already possible to build some decent static sites with the project, details below.

## Documentation

Please see the [silkyweb.org site](http://www.silkyweb.org/) for documentation.
